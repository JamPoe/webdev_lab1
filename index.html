  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
  <p>I'm currently enrolled in IIT's bachelor program for Information Technology</p>
  <p>Besides computer science, I enjoy gardening, philosophy, hiking, and quality time with friends</p>
  <p>It's been some time since I've explored web development, so I'm hoping to touch up on my skills and hopefully learn something new</p>
